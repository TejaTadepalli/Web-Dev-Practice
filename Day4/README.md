### Day 4 - Hidden Search

This is a simple project that uses CSS transitions to create a hidden search bar. The search bar is hidden by default and when the user clicks on the question icon, the search bar slides out from the right. When the user clicks on the search icon, the search bar slides back in.

# Notes:
Extra: Added a Question icon which will open the search bar when clicked.
