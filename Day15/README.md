### Day 15 - Incrementing Counter

This is a simple project that has a counter of Twitter Followers, Youtube Subscribers and Facebook Fans. The counter is incremented by 1 every second till it reaches the current value.

### Notes:

- I was unable to increment all the counters to different numbers. Hence just used a sample value and incremented it by 1 every second.
