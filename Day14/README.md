### Day 14 - Animated Navigation

This is a simple project that has a simple navigation bar with a hamburger menu. The menu is animated to slide in and out of the screen. The menu items are also animated to slide in and out of the screen.

#### Note:
- To make it look similar to the original, I used the same code of the body in the CSS section.
